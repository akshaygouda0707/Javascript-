const  foo= () =>{
console.log("hello");
}
foo() //Invoke the function with variable.
```

Ex-2:funtion as an agrument to another function.
```
funtion sayHelo(){
    return "hello,"
}
```
```
funtion greet(helloMsg,name){
    console.log(helloMsg()+name);
}
greet(sayHelo,"javascript");
```
* output: hello,javascript


Ex-3: return funtion inside funtion
```
function Hello(){
    return ()=>{
